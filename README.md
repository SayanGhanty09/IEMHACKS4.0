AI Health Prediction System

## 💻 Hardware AI — On-Device Biomarker Estimation

The hardware component of **Anibilin** is powered by an **ESP32-S3** and is designed to estimate important health biomarkers directly on the device.

Instead of sending raw sensor data to a cloud server, the system processes the optical signals locally and performs lightweight machine-learning calculations on the ESP32-S3.

### 🩺 Biomarkers Estimated

The hardware currently focuses on:

* 🫁 **SpO₂**
* ❤️ **Heart Rate**
* 🩸 **Hemoglobin (Hb)**
* 🟡 **Bilirubin**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The device uses a **multispectral optical sensing system** to collect information from different wavelengths of light.

The general pipeline is:

```text
Optical Sensor
      ↓
Raw Signal Acquisition
      ↓
Signal Processing
      ↓
Feature Extraction
      ↓
On-Device ML Models
      ↓
Biomarker Estimation
```

The important part is that the ML inference happens **directly on the ESP32-S3**, allowing the device to operate without depending on cloud-based computation.

## 🧠 On-Device Machine Learning

Different biomarkers require different levels of mathematical processing.

### 1. Simple Calibration Models

For measurements such as **SpO₂ and Heart Rate**, the system uses lightweight calibration models based on key characteristics extracted from the optical signal.

These models are computationally inexpensive and suitable for real-time execution on the ESP32-S3.

### 2. Multispectral Regression Models

For more complex biomarkers such as **Hemoglobin and Bilirubin**, the system uses multiple optical features obtained from different wavelengths.

A regression-based ML approach combines these features to estimate the corresponding biomarker value.

This helps the system account for variations caused by factors such as:

* Skin pigmentation
* Tissue properties
* Optical scattering
* Sensor conditions
* Individual physiological differences

The exact feature engineering, wavelength combinations, calibration parameters, and trained coefficients are part of our **proprietary implementation** and are not disclosed in this repository.

## ⭐ Why On-Device AI?

Running the ML models directly on the ESP32-S3 provides several advantages:

* ⚡ Real-time processing
* 🔒 Reduced dependency on cloud services
* 📡 Can operate with limited connectivity
* 💾 Low computational and memory requirements
* 🔋 Suitable for portable devices
* 🧠 Edge-based AI inference

## 🔬 Our Approach

The key idea behind Anibilin is to combine:

**Multispectral sensing + Signal Processing + Edge AI**

to create a compact system capable of estimating multiple biomarkers from optical measurements.

Rather than relying on a single sensor reading, the system analyzes information across multiple optical channels and uses trained models to obtain more meaningful estimations.

> 🔐 **Implementation Note:** The detailed optical feature engineering, sensor configuration, calibration methodology, regression coefficients, and model parameters are intentionally not published to protect the project's intellectual property.

---

## ⚠️ Research Disclaimer

Anibilin is currently a **research and engineering prototype**. The estimated biomarker values are not intended to replace laboratory blood tests, professional medical evaluation, or clinically validated diagnostic equipment.

## 💻 Software 
The software component of the project uses a **machine-learning based health risk prediction system** to estimate the risk of four major health conditions:

* 🧪 **High Cholesterol**
* ❤️ **Heart Disease**
* 🩸 **Anaemia**
* 🟡 **Jaundice**

The system processes patient demographic information, lifestyle factors, symptoms, family history, vital signs, and laboratory measurements through a customized ML preprocessing pipeline.

### ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Each model uses a customized `ColumnTransformer` pipeline.

**Numerical Features**

* Missing values → Median Imputation
* Feature scaling → `StandardScaler`

**Categorical Features**

* Missing values → `"None"` / most-frequent imputation
* Encoding → `OneHotEncoder`

This ensures that raw patient data can be directly passed through the same preprocessing pipeline used during training.

### 🤖 ML Model Architecture

Four independent models are used for the four health conditions:

| Health Condition | ML Model             | Configuration                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧪 Cholesterol   | `LogisticRegression` | `C=1.0`, `solver=lbfgs`                          |
| ❤️ Heart Disease | `LogisticRegression` | `C=1.0`, `solver=lbfgs`                          |
| 🩸 Anaemia       | `XGBClassifier`      | `n_estimators=100`                               |
| 🟡 Jaundice      | `LogisticRegression` | `C=1.0`, `solver=lbfgs`, `class_weight=balanced` |

All models use:

```text
random_state = 42
```

The models were selected after comparing candidate architectures using stratified evaluation.

---

### 📈 Risk Prediction

Instead of returning only a binary `0` or `1`, the system generates a **continuous risk probability between 0 and 1** using model probability prediction.

Example:

```text
Cholesterol Risk     → 0.82
Heart Disease Risk   → 0.64
Anaemia Risk         → 0.21
Jaundice Risk        → 0.08
```

#### Risk Classification

| Risk Probability | Category     |
| ---------------: | ------------ |
|    `0.00 – 0.29` | 🟢 Low       |
|    `0.30 – 0.59` | 🟡 Moderate  |
|    `0.60 – 0.79` | 🟠 High      |
|    `0.80 – 1.00` | 🔴 Very High |
